# Student-Progression-Predictor
Python

Part 1 - Main Version
The program aims to allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each academic year, prompting for the number of credits at pass, defer, and fail and then displaying the appropriate progression outcome for each individual student. Validation is also crucial, with the program displaying 'Integer required' if a credit input is the wrong data type, 'Out of range' if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, and 'Total incorrect' if the total of pass, defer, and fail credits is not 120.

The program loops to allow a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple students, prompting for credits at pass, defer, and fail and displaying the appropriate progression for each individual student until the staff member enters 'q' to quit. An example of a program run combined with a histogram (8 marks) is provided, where each star represents a student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module retriever, and exclude. The histogram should relate to the data input entered during the program run and work for any number of outcomes.

Part 2 â€“ List (extension)
In Part 1, most solutions use variables for input data storage. In Part 2, the solution should store input progression data in a list or nested list, access the stored data, and print it in the format provided.

Text File (extension)
Create an additional Part 3 program or extend your original version using Python to save inputted progression data to a text file. Access the stored data later in the program and print it out.

Dictionary (separate program)
In Part 4, create a program that saves input progression data to a dictionary or nested dictionary, accesses the data, prints it to the screen, collects unique student IDs, and displays the outcomes.
